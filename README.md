# Minesweeper

![Getting Started](Minesweeper.png)

Create a button to create a new game. Use the animated gif above as a user interface guide. Do at least that much, but also feel free to have fun.
Style the cells appropriately.
Left-clicking a cell performs the check action
Right/secondary clicking a cell performs the flag action
When the game status changed to won or lost a victory or failure message - Do not use alert for this. Update the user interface.

Before creating the game, allow the user to choose: Easy, Medium, or Hard mode.
Have fun with the styling. Make it your own.
